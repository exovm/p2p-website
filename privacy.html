                    <p>welcome to p2p, a discord bot designed to provide verification, moderation, and server management tools. this privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect user data when you or your server use p2p. by adding or using p2p in your discord server, you agree to the terms described below.</p>
                    <p>if you have any questions, please contact us at tarajijonesm21811@gmail.com or through discord (exovm).</p>

                    <h2>2. information we collect</h2>

                    <h3>a. user information</h3>
                    <p>p2p may collect and temporarily store the following discord-related data:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>p2p does not collect personal information such as email addresses, passwords, ip addresses, or payment information.</p>

                    <h3>b. server information</h3>
                    <p>to function properly, p2p may collect:</p>

                    <h3>c. logs</h3>
                    <p>p2p may temporarily log certain actions for debugging, moderation, or performance monitoring. these logs may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>user command usage</li>

                        <li>error reports</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>logs are stored securely and automatically deleted after a reasonable period (usually within 30–60 days).</p>

                <div class="tos-block">
                    <h2>3. how we use the information</h2>
                    <p>the data collected by p2p is used solely to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>operate and maintain bot functions</li>
                        <li>perform verification and moderation tasks</li>
                        <li>improve reliability and performance</li>
                        <li>investigate abuse or technical issues</li>
                        <li>enforce the terms of service</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>we do not sell, trade, or share user data with third parties.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tos-block">
                    <h2>4. data retention</h2>
                    <p>we keep collected data only as long as it's necessary for p2p to function. most information (like verification or moderation logs) is automatically deleted after 30–60 days. if a server removes p2p, all stored configuration data for that server is deleted automatically within 72 hours.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tos-block">
                    <h2>5. data security</h2>
                    <p>we take security seriously.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>all stored data is encrypted and accessible only to the bot owner.</li>
                        <li>no raw data is shared publicly.</li>
                        <li>access to logs and configurations is restricted to authorized personnel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>while we use reasonable security measures, no system is completely secure. by using p2p, you acknowledge and accept this risk.</p>

                <div class="tos-block">
                    <h2>6. your rights</h2>
                    <p>if you are a discord user in a server using p2p, you may request:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a copy of any data stored about you</li>

                        <li>deletion of stored data</li>

                    <p>requests can be made through email (tarajijonesm21811@gmail.com) or discord (exovm). we may ask for verification to confirm your identity before fulfilling your request.</p>
